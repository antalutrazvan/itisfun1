### Session One

---

### Scope
### Hoisting
### Closures

---
### Scope

"Scope is the `part` or `section` of a program where a `definition` is visible."

---
<CodeSurfer 
theme={nightOwl}
notes="what is a definiton?"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/vars.jsx")}
steps={[
  { range: [3, 5], notes: "variables"},
  { range: [9, 11], notes: "named functions" }
]}  
/>

---
 **Scope** can be clasified as:
- `global`
- `module`
- `file`
- `function` 
- `block`
- `expression`
---
JavaScript has `global` and `function` scope.

`block` scope was added as part of the `ES6` spec.

---
 ### GLOBAL SCOPE

 "A `variable` is visible to the `whole` program after it was `declared`."

---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Global Scope"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="global scope"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/global_numbers.html")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1,3,5,8], notes: "let's load 2 separate scripts"},
  { range: [1,3], notes: "define a variable in one"},
  { range: [5,8], notes: "And try to log it in the other" },
  { range: [1, 8], notes: "`numbers` is declared in the global scope and visible" },
  
]}  
/>
---
### Function Scope

"When `called`, a `function` `body` will define a new `context`, where `variables` will be visible in it, but not outside of it."
---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Function Scope"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="function scope"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/local_numbers.jsx")}
steps={[
  { range: [1,4], notes: "let's declare a count function"},
  { range: [1,6], notes: "we call it"},
  { range: [1,8], notes: "if we try to log numbers, it will throw an error"},
]}  
/>
---
 Important to note:

 All `undeclared` variable assignments inside a script, wether inside a `function` or not, will be added by the `interpreter` to the `global` scope.
---
<CodeSurfer 
theme={nightOwl}
notes="it's the same script from before"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/scope_gotcha.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [2], notes: "but we dont `declare` numbers, we just initialize it"},
  { range: [1, 8], notes: "if we log it outside the scope, it will be defined globally"},
]}  
/>
---

### Block scope

"A code `block` (usually `{}` but it can be some other sintax) defines a new `name context`."

---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Block Scope"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="simple block scope example"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/block_scope.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1,2,16], notes: "the `main` function will be our first scope"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,16], notes: "it declares a `counter` variable with the value 2"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5, 16], notes: "and increments it"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5,6, 16], notes: "counter will be 3"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5,6, 8,9,14, 16], notes: "if we declare a block"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5,6, 8,9, 10, 14, 16], notes: "and declare counter again with value 3"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5,6, 8,9, 10, 12, 14, 16], notes: "and increment it"},
  { lines: [1,2,3,5,6, 8,9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16], notes: "the value will be 4"},
  { lines: [10], notes: "this works because we used `let` to declare counter again, inside the block"},
  { range: [1, 21] }
]}  
/>
---

An important feature to note is that nested function `scopes` are `chained`.

What that means is that, an `inner function`, can reference all the variables that it's `outer function` can.

---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Scope Chaining"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="scope chains"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/scope_chain.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1, 4, 20], notes: "let's create a function with a variable inside it" },
  { lines: [1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 19, 20], notes: "it declares another function with it's own variable" },
  { range: [1, 20], notes: "and a third one" },
  { lines: [1,2], notes: "the call to `one` will output all the variables" },
  { range: [1, 20] },
]}  
/>
---

Why could I `call` all those `functions`, before I defined them ?

Well, it works because of `hoisting`.
---
### Hoisting

`hoisting` is a behaviour where `variable` and `named` `function` declarations are moved to the `top` of their `scope`.

---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Hoisting - Variable"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="simple message example"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/hoisting_simple.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1, 4, 6], notes: "lets take these 3 statements" },
  { lines: [1], notes: "we log a `message` variable" },
  { lines: [4], notes: "then declare, and assign a value to it." },
  { lines: [6], notes: "then then log it again." },
  { range: [1, 2], notes: "We would expect a ReferenceError at the first log" },
  { range: [1, 7], notes: "but because of hoisting" },
  { range: [9, 16], notes: "The interpeter will read this" },
  { range: [1, 16] },
]}  
/>
---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Hoisting - Function"
theme={nightOwl}
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/hoisting_function.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "this is how much money we have" },
  { lines: [1, 9, 10, 11], notes: "this is a function to add some money to our bank" },
  { lines: [1,3, 9, 10, 11], notes: "we can use add to add some money" },
  { lines: [1,3,4, 9, 10, 11], notes: "even before we declared it" },
  { lines: [1,3,4,5, 9, 10, 11], notes: "because it will be hoisted to the top of this scope" },
  { lines: [1,3,4,5, 7, 9, 10, 11], notes: "at the end we'll have 25 RON" },
]}  
/>
---

We can use this code to create a `wallet`. that will keep a private record of our money, and allow us to add to it.

Doing this, we'll get to make use of `Closures`.

---
### Closure

We say that a `variable` is `kept` in a `closure` when it is referenced by another `function` after the function that `defined it` has `finished execution`.
---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Closure"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="wallet example"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/closure_bank.jsx")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1, 13], notes: "we'll create a `wallet` function that recieves an inital amount" },
  { lines: [1, 2, 13], notes: "we'll keep a variable to store our `money` and set it to `amount`" },
  { lines: [1, 2, 4,5,6, 13], notes: "we'll create a function to add a value to our current amount" },
  { lines: [1, 2, 4,5,6, 8,9,10, 13], notes: "and one to view our current amount" },
  { lines: [1, 2, 4,5,6, 8,9,10,12, 13], notes: "and return an object with those functions as properties" },
  { range: [1, 15], notes: "we can then create our wallet" },
  { range: [1, 17], notes: "add to it" },
  { range: [1, 18], notes: "and see how much we have" },
  { range: [1, 18] },
]}  
/>

 Here's another example
---
<CodeSurfer 
title="Closure - Extra"
theme={nightOwl}
notes="list nodes example"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/list_extra.html")}
steps={[
  {lines: [1], notes: "lets create a list"},
  {lines: [2, 16], notes: "and a script to modify that list"},
  {lines: [3, 4], notes: "it has some data, and a reference to that list"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 15], notes: "and for each entry"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 15, 7], notes: "we create a `li` node"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 15, 7,9 ], notes: "set its content"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15], notes: "and add it to the list"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15], notes: "afterwards we'll add a click listener"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15], notes: "that logs each item"},
  {lines: [1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17,18,19,20,21,22], notes: "when we click on each item, the value will be refrenced from the closure"},
  {range: [1, 22]}
]}  
/>
