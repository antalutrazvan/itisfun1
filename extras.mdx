## Functions

`"subroutines"`

 - they are groups of statements or expressions - `function body`
 - that can be `called` - either externaly or internaly (recursion)
 - they can recieve `arguments` for each `call` and can `return` a value at any point during execution.

I encourage you to dig deeper into this, and experiment as much as you can.
They are concepts that will help you greatly in understanding and writing code.
And inch you closer to the goal of delivering better, more interesting products.
